# 80-20RuleSimulator
 When played, this project is meant to represent a real life simultation of the 80-20 rule. To be absolutely categorically clear, I am not a game developer. The purpose of this project was to show of my design pattern skills and overall coding capabilities. I purely decided to make this a Unity project because I was tired of showing the result of my c# and java console projects to "civilians" and have them think they could probably do the same because it's just letters on a black screen. To be fair, its also to keep things interesting and learn new skills.
